# Odin: A Windsurf and Cursor-Inspired AI Assistant with Local LLM Integration

## Project Overview
Odin is an AI-powered development assistant inspired by Windsurf and Cursor, designed to streamline coding workflows through a combination of graphical (GUI) and command-line (CLI) interfaces. It leverages large language models (LLMs) to provide intelligent code suggestions, project scaffolding, and iterative development support, with a strong emphasis on privacy through local LLM integration. Tailored for developers working with Python, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and their frameworks, Odin offers flexible AI capabilities that adapt to various hardware setups, making it accessible to both technical and non-technical users.

## Core Features
- **LLM Chat Interface:** Engage with AI assistants directly within the application for real-time coding assistance.
- **File Creation and Editing:** Seamlessly create and modify code files with AI-powered suggestions and automation.
- **Downloadable LLMs:** Choose and install your preferred LLM from a curated repository, similar to LLM Studio.
- **Hardware Adaptation:** Odin assesses your systemâ€™s capabilities and recommends online LLM options (e.g., Grok, Claude, OpenAI, DeepSeek) if your hardware falls below the recommended spec (RTX 3060 equivalent).
- **Supported Languages:** Python, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and popular frameworks like Django, React, and Node.js.
- **Project Initialization:** Start new projects by providing a text or .md file with instructions, which Odin parses to generate the initial project structure.
- **Additional Capabilities:** Question answering, web search, content analysis, conversational dialogue, and reasoning to enhance the development experience.

## File Editing Capabilities
- **File Operations:** Open, read, modify, and save code files, with a focus on Python, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.
- **AI-Assisted Editing:** Use LLMs to generate code snippets, suggest improvements, and apply changes with user approval.
- **Multi-File Support:** Work on multiple files simultaneously, with optional Git integration for version control.
- **Security:** Changes are made with notifications and detailed logging, enabling easy review and rollback.

## Local LLM Integration
- **Local Hosting:** Interface with locally hosted LLMs (e.g., via Ollama, LM Studio).
- **Primary Engine:** Rely on local LLMs for coding assistance and general queries.
- **Cloud-Based Models:** Switch to providers like OpenAI or Anthropic as needed, configurable in settings.
- **Fallback Mechanism:** Includes a lightweight, coding-focused LLM for offline use or lower-spec systems.
- **Privacy:** Prioritizes local processing, with cloud usage only when explicitly authorized.

## User Interface
- **GUI:** Built with Electron and React, featuring a code editor, Windsurf-inspired file explorer, and LLM chat panel.
- **CLI:** Offers full functionality via command line, including LLM interactions and file editing.
- **Status Indicator:** Displays whether the active LLM is local or cloud-based.

## Additional Requirements
- **Mode Switching:** Seamlessly transition between local and cloud LLMs based on availability and user preference.
- **Operating Modes:**
  - **Local-Only Mode:** Operates without external calls, using only the local LLM.
  - **Hybrid Mode:** Combines the local LLM with optional web lookups for enhanced responses.
- **Future Flexibility:** Designed to support model parameter adjustments (e.g., temperature, max tokens) in future updates.

## Technical Specifications
- **Languages:** Python, JavaScript, CSS, HTML.
- **LLM Communication:** Utilizes REST API or gRPC for interfacing with LLMs.
- **Modular Design:** Structured for easy maintenance and extensibility.
- **Error Handling:** Robust mechanisms for handling LLM unavailability or misconfiguration.
- **Performance:** Optimized for low latency (targeting 2-3 second AI responses), with visual feedback during processing (e.g., "Generating..." or "Thinking...").

## User Experience
- **Intuitive Design:** Simple setup with minimal configuration, ideal for non-technical users.
- **Setup Guidance:** Includes wizards and automated checks for configuring the local LLM.
- **Feedback Mechanisms:** Provides clear messages and confirmation prompts for critical actions.
- **Support for Non-Technical Users:** Enforces best practices like documentation, testing, and design patterns.
- **File Modifications:** Changes are accompanied by notifications and logging, with rollback options.
- **Checkpoint System:** Saves project states (objectives, variables, configurations) to maintain context across sessions.
- **Virtual File System:** Allows users to preview changes before applying them, with explanations of their impact.

## Example Workflow
1. Open Odin and load a project directory.
2. Provide a .md file with project instructions (e.g., "Build a React app with a login page").
3. Odin parses the instructions and generates the initial code structure.
4. Use the LLM chat panel to refine and iterate on the code.
5. Preview and approve changes via the virtual file system.
6. Save and commit changes, with optional Git integration.

## Development Roadmap
1. **Prototype Core Interfaces:** Develop the GUI with a code editor and file explorer, alongside a CLI with basic commands.
2. **Integrate LLMs:** Establish connections for local and cloud-based models, including the downloadable LLM feature.
3. **Implement Workflow:** Enable parsing of text/.md inputs, code generation, and file management.
4. **Enhance User Experience:** Add the checkpoint system, virtual file system, and features to support non-technical users.
5. **Optimize and Test:** Focus on performance optimization and prepare for beta testing once the prototype is stable.
6. **Future Features:** Plan integration with Docker, collaborative editing via GitHub, and deployment support for platforms like AWS and Vercel.
